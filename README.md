## 2. Getting Started

### Installation

To start using DesignFlow CSS, simply download the `designflow.css` and `designflow.js` files from the official repository (or provided download link).

#### Step 1: Download the Files

1. Download the `designflow.css` and `designflow.js` files.
2. Place them in your project‚Äôs directory, preferably in a `css` or `assets` folder for better organization.

#### Step 2: Link the Files in Your HTML

Include the DesignFlow CSS and JS files in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>üê£DesignFlow | QuickStart</title>
    <!-- üê£DesignFlowCss -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/designflow.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/normal.css" />
    <script src="path/to/designflow.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Basic Usage
Once you have linked the DesignFlow files, you can start using the classes provided by the framework to style your elements.

Example: Creating a Simple Centered Heading
html

```html
<section class="home flex items-center justify-center">
  <div class="fsz-30px fade-in-first">
      <strong>üê£Design</strong>FlowCss
  </div>
</section>
```
In this example:

- ```flex items-center justify-center```: Centers the content both vertically and horizontally.
- ```fsz-30px```: Sets the font size to 30px.

## 3. Core Features

DesignFlow CSS is built to empower developers and designers to rapidly prototype UIs while maintaining creative freedom. Below are some of the core features that make DesignFlow stand out:

### 1. Simple and Intuitive Classes

DesignFlow CSS offers a collection of simple, intuitive classes that make it easy to apply styles without the need for extensive custom CSS. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can quickly implement design elements with minimal effort.

**Example: Basic Layout**

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-between p-20px">
    <div class="box shadow-lg">Box 1</div>
    <div class="box shadow-lg">Box 2</div>
</div>
```

- ```flex```: Enables flexbox for the container.
- ```items-cente```r: Vertically centers the content.
- ```justify-between```: Distributes items evenly with space between.
- ```p-20px```: Adds 20px padding.

### 2. Built-in Effects and Animations
DesignFlow CSS includes built-in effects like Glassmorphism and Neumorphism, as well as animations that can be applied with just a single class.

Example: Glassmorphism Card

```html
<div class="glass p-40px m-20px">
    <h2 class="fsz-24px">Welcome to DesignFlow</h2>
</div>
```
- ```glass```: Applies a frosted glass effect.
- ```p-40px``` and ```m-20px```: Adds padding and margin for spacing.
- ```fsz-24px```: Sets the font size to 24px.

### 3. Quick Prototyping
The framework is designed with rapid prototyping in mind. You can swiftly create and test layouts, effects, and interactions without writing a single line of custom CSS.

Example: Neumorphism Button

```html
<button class="neumorphism fsz-18px p-10px">Click Me</button>
```
- ```neumorphism```: Gives the button a soft, raised look.
- ```fsz-18px```: Sets the font size to 18px.
- ```p-10px```: Adds 10px padding around the text.

### 4. Customization and Flexibility
While DesignFlow CSS is powerful out-of-the-box, it‚Äôs also highly customizable. You can easily override or extend the default styles with your own custom CSS to match your project‚Äôs needs.

Example: Overriding Styles

```CSS
/* Custom Styles */
.custom-btn {
    background-color: #ff5733;
    border-radius: 8px;
}
```
```html
<button class="custom-btn fsz-20px p-15px">Custom Button</button>
.custom-btn: Adds a custom background color and border radius.
```

### 4. Semantic Classes
One of the key concepts behind DesignFlow CSS is the use of semantic classes. These classes are named to represent the function or role of the element in your UI, making your HTML more meaningful and easier to work with. By using semantic class names, you can improve the clarity of your code and create a more maintainable and scalable design system.

#### 1. What Are Semantic Classes?
Semantic classes are class names that reflect the purpose or identity of the element they are styling. Instead of using arbitrary or purely stylistic names, semantic classes describe what the element is or does.

Example:

```html
<div class="card bgw flex w-410px h-100px items-center gap-20px p-10px radius-10px shadow-smr cursor-pointer fade-in-first">
    <img src="img/user-1.svg" alt="user-image" width="72" />
    <div class="details linel:1px,#ccc pl-10px">
        <strong class="tpr">Footprint Arts</strong>
        <p class="tsc text-sm">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="time textsz-12px flex flex-col items-center gap-3px">
        <p>16:47pm</p>
        <div class="unread w-20px h-20px bgpr text-white flex justify-center rounded">2</div>
    </div>
</div>
```
In this example:

- ```card``` describes the element as a card component.
- ```details``` groups the text and description of the card.
- ```time``` specifies the area where the time is displayed.
- ```unread``` indicates the section that shows unread messages.

#### 2. Benefits of Using Semantic Classes
- Clarity: Your HTML becomes self-explanatory, making it easier to understand the structure and purpose of each element.
- Maintainability: It‚Äôs easier to manage and update your styles when your class names reflect the role of the elements they are applied to.
- Scalability: As your project grows, semantic class names help you maintain a consistent naming convention, making your codebase more scalable.
  
### 3. Examples of Semantic Classes in DesignFlow
Here are some examples of how semantic classes can be used in various contexts within DesignFlow CSS:

1. Layout Grouping:

```html
<div class="biggroup flex mb-10px">
    <div class="group flex-1">
        <h1 class="fsz-72px ff-Heading1 fade-in-first">DealBook Summit</h1>
        <p class="fsz-26px ff-Heading2 fade-in-second">
            Business. Politics. Culture. Where it all connects.
        </p>
        <p class="fsz-26px ff-Heading2 decoration-underline fade-in-second">
            November 29, 2023
        </p>
        <p class="fsz-26px ff-Heading2 fade-in-second">New York City</p>
    </div>
    <button class="button px-20px py-10px bgc-transparent self-center fade-in-first">
        LEARN MORE
    </button>
</div>
```
In this example:

- ```biggroup```: Groups multiple sections into a larger container.
- ```group```: Represents a smaller grouping within the biggroup.
- ```button```: Clearly indicates a button element, simplifying identification.

2. Title and Input Fields:

```html
<div class="title flex items-center justify-between">
    <h1>Share</h1>
    <div class="icon">‚ñº</div>
</div>
<div class="input mt-20px bgc-#eee flex p-8px gap-10px radius-8px mb-25px">
    <img src="img/search-icon.svg" alt="search-icon" />
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search" class="outline-none bgc-transparent border-none text-sm" />
</div>
```
In this example:

- ```title```: Indicates a title section.
- ```icon```: Represents an icon within the title.
- ```input```: Defines a styled input area for user interaction.

3. Applying Semantic Classes in Your Projects
When using DesignFlow CSS, consider adopting semantic class names to keep your HTML clear and organized. Name your classes based on the component‚Äôs function, such as header, footer, content, or sidebar. This practice helps you and your team quickly grasp the structure and purpose of each part of your project.
